# cdss-archive-nsis-2.46

This is an archive of NSIS 2.46 software environment that has been used with CDSS Java software installers
including TSTool, StateDMI, StateView, and StateMod GUI.

The repository was created by copying the `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS` folder to the repository.

This archive is needed because NSIS 2.46 is several years old and it is unclear where all the user contributor and plugin
files came from.  The archive files can be copied and used until NSIS software is updated to the latest.
